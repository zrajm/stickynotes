  A hook/callback to be invoked whenever the note cache contents change (for
  updating the JSON in the background), and maybe initialize push to server.

  get(id) -- Return one note.

  set() -- Should keep track of changed values, so that push() can push the
  smallest possible changeset.

  push() -- Should push all notes that have been updated (no id should have to
  be provided).

  Should automatically do long pulling from server.
