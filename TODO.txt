* TODO Sync full state at time intervals
  Should check occasionally that everything is up-to-date with server, so that
  if notes get fucked up they auto-adjust after some time interval. (A checksum
  ping?)
* TODO Lock note that is being moved by other client
  Make it transparent?
* TODO Error when server isn't responding
  Background goes red? Dashed lines? Move sticky back if it's move cannot be
  registered with server?
* TODO Load list of stickies from server too
* TODO Creating notes
* TODO Deleting notes
* TODO Proper, random sticky IDs
* TODO Note cache should be a module
  A hook/callback to be invoked whenever the note cache contents change (for
  updating the JSON in the background), and maybe initialize push to server.

  get(id) -- Return one note.

  set() -- Should keep track of changed values, so that push() can push the
  smallest possible changeset.

  push() -- Should push all notes that have been updated (no id should have to
  be provided).

  Should automatically do long pulling from server.

** DONE Dragging should only affect dragged item
   CLOSED: [2015-05-02 Sat 21:24]
   jQuery UI 'stack'ing shouldn't be used when dragging, as this forces updates
   of all stickies.
