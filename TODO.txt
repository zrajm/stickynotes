* TODO Creating notes
* TODO Deleting notes
* TODO Better separation between server & notes
  The parsing of server response, and putting into note cache should not be
  inside the note cache module.
* TODO Sessions
  Should automatically be created when invoked. Use hashlocation to initiate
  one.
* TODO Sync full state at time intervals
  Should check occasionally that everything is up-to-date with server, so that
  if notes get fucked up they auto-adjust after some time interval. (A checksum
  ping?)
* TODO Lock note for which server connection has been lost
  Make it transparent & disable draggability?
* TODO Lock note that is being moved by other client
  Make it transparent & disable draggability?
* TODO Load list of stickies from server too
* TODO Proper, random sticky IDs
* TODO No events on notes, instead capture them on <main>
* TODO BUGFIX: Place cursor anywhere in text
  Currently cursor can only be placed at beginning of text inside the stickies,
  this is caused by the jQuery UI 'draggable' effect somehow. Will probably
  have to reimplement the draggable (and drop jQuery UI?) to fix this.

** DONE Dragging should only affect dragged item
   CLOSED: [2015-05-02 Sat 21:24]
   jQuery UI 'stack'ing shouldn't be used when dragging, as this forces updates
   of all stickies.
** DONE Slightly rotated stickies
   CLOSED: [2015-05-02 Sat 22:21]
   Do this randomly on reload.

       -webkit-transform: rotate(XXdeg);

   where XX is a random number between 5.0 and -5.0

   A hook/callback to be invoked whenever the note cache contents change (for
   updating the JSON in the background), and maybe initialize push to server.
